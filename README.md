A basic ldap server in a docker container with admin gui.

Created by following this guide
https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-configure-a-basic-ldap-server-on-an-ubuntu-12-04-vps

Still WIP.

TODO: Initial config

TODO: Directories /etc/ldap and /usr/share/slapd must be saved outside.
